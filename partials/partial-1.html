<h2 class="title-1"> The Value of Money</h2>
<img class="article-1" src='images/article-1.jpg' alt="money">
<p class="a1">Money? A value different to many people. To some people money means nothing, whereas to some it does. Some see money as a form of granting us happiness, even the simple forms of pleasures such as purchasing an ice cream cown. Some see money as an asset and that it could never buy us our happiness. They mostly think, "this piece of printed paper, can truly not be the source of my happiness" and then start going into the philosphical values that life provides us instead. In some countries, the exchange rate is so high that the value of their money is so valuable... Whereas in some countries their exchange rates are so low that, its either so hard to come by or its not. I'm not the most economically educated person ever, but from the experiences of travel and spending different currencies in different places... The value of money just flatuates. No spending, carelessly spending... What is the value of money? Its a question that can be answered differently no matter who you ask. Views on this topic are never ending and continuously being expressed. Money? Its value is priceless. </p>
<h2 class="title-2"> GMO Food</h2>
<img src="images/article-2.jpg" class="article-2" alt="food">
<p class="a2">GMO stands for Genetically Modified Organisms; which are chemicals that are used in food production and agriculture to enhance their natural properties. Most of their foods will be found in grocerry stores in various aisles, especially the fresh fruit and vegetable sections. How do these chemicals affect our food? For example it makes an apple more red and pulp... Yet it decays and molds faster than an organically grown and natural fertilized apple. Other results include the differentiating look in sizes. GMOs have negative impacts to our health that could develop or perhaps spark different diseases in our body. Some diseases are temporary and could be resolved, while others are problematic and lead to harsh treatements in medical facilities. The reason GMOs are even implemented into the food industry could be because of the expenses and results they archeive in the end products. This also includes the low prices that are also shown in regular super markets, where it is cheaper to purchase.</p>
<p class="a2">Individuals have tried protesting against food companies and farming lands to stop the usage of GMOs in their man-made products and grown foods. Special supermarkets are open for this reason to battle against the GMOs food industry. Their products are all GMO free and organically prduced and grown.</p>
<h2 class="title-3">The World in 2100</h2>
<img src="images/article-3.jpg" class="article-3" alt="globe">
<p class="a3">2100 is decades into the future and it makes us very curious as to how the human race would have evolved by then. Would we have fixed out planet? Terminated all our environmental issues? Or perhaps we just moved our lives to Mars? The world is constantly changing and there is never anything that is for sure or even relatively constant. In the year 2000, we all thought we would all be using flying cars and living in levitating homes... But life was exactly the same except for the evolution of technology, fashion and the economy making major hits and fails throughout the years. The World in 2100, so I would like to hope, will be better than it is now. Hopeful predications would include, all of the world having access to clean water, our Carbon Dioxide levels have decreased and the economy is certainly booming. There is no division between countries and peace is what we have acheived with one another. Educational facilities opened in all the parts of the world that we deemed lacking before. The world of 2100 is a hopeful way of thinking that the human race has battled and defeated most of the down sides we may have faced during the decades before it.</p>
